    "## Weight Absorption in Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Low-Rank Compression of Keys and Values\n",
    "In **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)**, the model applies a low-rank compression to the **Keys (K)** and **Values (V)** using a latent vector \\( c \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The projections are defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "Q = x W_q\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "K = c W_{uk}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( x \\) is the input token representation  \n",
    "- \\( c \\) is the latent vector (compressed representation)  \n",
    "- \\( W_q \\) is the query projection matrix  \n",
    "- \\( W_{uk} \\) is the key projection matrix  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Weight Absorption (Matrix Fusion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both queries and keys participate in the attention dot product, their projection matrices can be **mathematically combined**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By **pre-multiplying** the projection matrices \\( W_q \\) and \\( W_{uk} \\), the key-related weights are *absorbed* into the query projection. This results in a **single effective projection matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "QK^\\top = x W_q (c W_{uk})^\\top\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "= x (W_q W_{uk}^\\top) c^\\top\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, instead of computing two separate matrix multiplications during inference, the model performs **one fused matrix multiplication**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Optimization Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduced latency** due to fewer matrix multiplications during inference  \n",
    "- **Lower computational overhead**, especially for large models and long sequences  \n",
    "- **Inference-time optimization**, typically applied after training  \n",

    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, the absorbed weight matrix (e.g., `absorbed_k`) is stored using:\n",

    "```python\n",
