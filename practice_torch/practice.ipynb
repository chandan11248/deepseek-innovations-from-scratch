    "### What is `register_buffer`?\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, `register_buffer` is used to store non-trainable tensors as part of a model. These tensors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Saved and loaded with the model's `state_dict`.\n",
    "- Not updated during training (no gradients are computed for them).\n",
    "- Useful for storing constants, precomputed values, or intermediate results that are part of the model's state."
